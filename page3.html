        <p>Facebook is a popular social media platform that allows users to create profiles, upload photos and videos, send messages, and keep in touch with friends, family, and colleagues. It was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg and his college roommates Andrew McCollum, Chris Hughes, Dustin Moskovitz, and Eduardo Saverin. Users can add other users as "friends," exchange messages, post status updates, share photos, videos, and links, use various apps, and receive notifications of other users' activities. Additionally, users may join user groups, which are organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends." Over the years, Facebook has evolved into a platform for businesses as well, allowing companies to create pages, post updates, and advertise to targeted audiences.</p>
